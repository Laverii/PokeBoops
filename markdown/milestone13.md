DEVELOPMENT PLAN (5/23/17)
 
Andrew: Working on boostrap/UI
Austin: Search bar (HTML)
Peter: Look into EasyKVS database
Inkan: Seperate lost and found onto seperate pages, get form to post on map when using circle/polyline.


Inkan:
Alok and Kandarp helped us set up the Keeling.js to put information onto our homepage as well as put information into data.json when you submit at least the submit form. Over the weekend, I implemented the cirlce draw tool is to show the form and when it is submitted it appears on the map. I also moved the found form onto the home page. I was also looking into databses like PostgreSQL and Alok introduced me to EasyKVS as a database. I tried implementing PostgreSQL at the least but it didn't work so well. I'm trying right now to make a popup to ask if the item is lost or found, then takes the user to the appropriate form so they can submit it on the map. Having some toruble, so i may go to office hours but I will update if things changes.
