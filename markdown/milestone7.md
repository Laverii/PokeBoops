What each member did:

Austin:
I sourced Leaflet draw plugin mentioned by Inkan in order to allow radii and polylines to be drawn directly on the map by the user (as well as edited and deleted). I was able to get a bit of the functionality to work on my local computer: the toolbar was on the map, and its buttons performed the proper functions, though there were no icons within the bar and the lines/figures did not stay on the map after click release (likely due to not managing the layers properly). I also helped Inkan with debugging. 

Andrew:
I worked on making a menu bar for the app, and helped the others with debugging. I cleaned up index.html a bit by moving the style sheets to a dedicated main.css file. I created map.js and marker.js as well, but I have not populated those yet.

Peter:
I implemented the popup feature, when you clicked on the marker. I was also researching databases that were compatible with web applications, but I am having problems deciding which databases to use.

Inkan:
I made that the user can click on the map and make markers appear onto the map and added a temporary red marker that we can use. I also told the group about Leaflet.draw and also researched it as well, trying to figure out what the functions are and how to source it to our code so we can use the draw functions. I tried to source it (onto a test repo on my local computer), but I am having some trouble doing so.
