TA's and individual help:
Alok and Kandarp: Ajax and databases, they helped us get our data posted onto the website. Also helped Inkan with debugging and helping us get shape properties.
Chen: Inkan went to his office hours to get help on databases (like Keeling), debugging, and localstorage. 
Professor Guo: Helped Inkan with sourcing the leaflet.Draw files correctly so we can make the toolbar
Inkan's friend: A friend from outside the class. He helped me understand Leaflet popups, setStyle, and getting elementIds. He also helped me understand more about localstorage too.
