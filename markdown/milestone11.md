Milestone 11

Team PokeBoop, K1

Inkan:
Last Wednesday Andrew and I went to Chen's office hours. He helped us start up a basic node.js so we can store data, in which I pushed onto our repo. For this week, I was tasked with working on Boostrap. While I admit I could have done more, I looked into Bootstrap and started with a basic framework. With that, I was able to source Bootstrap onto our app and got working navigation bars for each page that we had.  This also helped update the text and forms on the pages. I hope to update more on it on the future. (https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/)

Last week I was able to get the editing functionality of the Leaflet.draw toolbars working. Based on week 6 feedback, I condensed such drawing operations this week to be more accessible to the user (they stated the initial tools available needlessly complicated the application). Additionally, I attempted to consolidate the map data (marker coordinates and radii) and user fields in the lost/found forms stored in the database. However, in this I was unsuccessful. I also looked into removing icons from the OpenStreetMap tileset (also indicated as a concern in feedback), though I realized that they're built into the tiles themselves; removing these icons would only be possible by rendering our own map tiles.
