Milestone 11

Team PokeBoop, K1

Inkan:
Last Wednesday Andrew and I went to Chen's office hours. He helped us start up a basic node.js so we can store data, in which I pushed onto our repo. For this week, I was tasked with working on Boostrap. While I admit I could have done more, I looked into Bootstrap and started with a basic framework. With that, I was able to source Bootstrap onto our app and got working navigation bars for each page that we had.  This also helped update the text and forms on the pages. I hope to update more on it on the future. (https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/)
