Milestone 11

Team PokeBoop, K1

Inkan:
Last Wednesday Andrew and I went to Chen's office hours. He helped us start up a basic node.js so we can store data, in which I pushed onto our repo. For this week, I was tasked with working on Boostrap. While I admit I could have done more, I looked into Bootstrap and started with a basic framework. With that, I was able to source Bootstrap onto our app and got working navigation bars for each page that we had.  This also helped update the text and forms on the pages. I hope to update more on it on the future. (https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/)

Peter:
This week, I was researching ajax and json to try to store data, but I got stuck on the actual implementation of the parsing/writing data to the
JSON file but I was able to replicate what was done on the found page on the lost page. When Inkan added the bootstrap stuff into the html pages, I debugged the pages to at least write some data that the user writes. I'm still working on writing the data. I may switch to another method of saving data like using something like a database like Google Firebase, since I saw some implementation of it on web application similar to what we're been doing.

Andrew:
I helped Peter debug the LostForm and helped get it to write data. Peter and I are still trying to figure out how to store this data into a JSON file though. I will be attending Chen's Office Hours again in a bit. Not sure if I'll be able to push an update to this markdown in time so I'm just leaving this message here for now. Will continue trying to get the data of map marker placements to be stored into a JSON file. I also helped Inkan with finding a basic bootstrap framework. I am also working on getting the lost pages and found pages to show up on the same screen rather than go to a separate page. 

Austin:
Last week I was able to get the editing functionality of the Leaflet.draw toolbars working. Based on week 6 feedback, I condensed such drawing operations this week to be more accessible to the user (they stated the initial tools available needlessly complicated the application). Additionally, I attempted to consolidate the map data (marker coordinates and radii) and user fields in the lost/found forms stored in the database. However, in this I was unsuccessful. I also looked into removing icons from the OpenStreetMap tileset (also indicated as a concern in feedback), though I realized that they're built into the tiles themselves; removing these icons would only be possible by rendering our own map tiles.
