Heilmeier's Catechism Elevator Pitch

What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
Our team is trying to get people reunited with their lost possessions at the UCSD campus.

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Today, lost and found items are posted about online in UCSD Facebook groups. However, not many people know about or check these specialized groups. 

What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Our team's approach similarly posts about items but represents this information visually and not within a limited space (e.g., a particular Facebook group). Specifcally, our approach allows an owner to retrace their steps and convey this information to others, increasing the likelihood that the item will be found.

Who cares? If you're successful what difference will it make?
Anyone who has ever lost a valuable possession would care about this solution. If our team is successful, more people will have their belongings safely returned to them.
