Inkan: Like the rest of the team, I also looked into Leaflet. I was trying to figure out how to make and render a map on the webpage. I helped make the skeleton of the index.html and with Peter's and leaflet tutorial's help, I was able to at least render the map on the screen. I added the d3 and leaflet repository into our own repository, however due to some issues we still need to source the original host leaflet instead of our repo.
