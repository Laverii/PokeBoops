Team PokeBoop, Team 19, K1

Team Contributions:

Austin: Looked into understanding Leaflet and D3 (discovered GeoJSON, shapefiles, and GIS which could be further integrated in this project). Also looked into creating paths/routes that the user could draw/trace via click events (functionality, not yet implemented). Wrote code in index.html to obtain data from our own repository instead of the URL used in the Leaflet tutorials and to set the map view. 

Andrew:

Peter: Like Austin, I looked into Leaflet. I was able to figure out how to make and render a map by researching different tutorials. I helped Inkan with learning how to rendering the map. I found out the coordinates to get the UCSD map, and how to make different markers. However, I have yet found out how to add markers by clicking on the map, which I am still researching.

Inkan: Like the rest of the team, I also looked into Leaflet. I was trying to figure out how to make and render a map on the webpage. I helped make the skeleton of the index.html and with Peter's and leaflet tutorial's help, I was able to at least render the map on the screen. I added the d3 and leaflet repository into our own repository, however due to some issues we still need to source the original host leaflet instead of our repo.
