Paper Prototypes

Inkan Hertanto:
![Home Page UI](https://github.com/Laverii/PokeBoops/blob/master/PaperPrototypes/paper_prototype_UI_Inkan_Hertanto.jpg)
My prototype shows the home page UI of our app. It introduces our app in the about us section, which is under a screenshot of our app and what it can do. It allows users to make a post on the home page based if they lost or found an item. There is also a menu in which the user can choose to go back to home, see the lost or found items, see the map with all the postings, or check their account settings.
