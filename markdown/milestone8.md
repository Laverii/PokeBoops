Paper Prototypes

Inkan Hertanto:
![Home Page UI](https://github.com/Laverii/PokeBoops/blob/master/PaperPrototypes/paper_prototype_UI_Inkan_Hertanto.jpg)
My prototype shows the home page UI of our app. It introduces our app in the about us section, which is under a screenshot of our app and what it can do. It allows users to make a post on the home page based if they lost or found an item. There is also a menu in which the user can choose to go back to home, see the lost or found items, see the map with all the postings, or check their account settings.

![Account Info UI]()
This paper prototype shows the interface for the userâ€™s account settings. Since this application relies on communication between strangers, there should be some form of contact between the person who found the item and the person who lost the item. This would specifically be found in the Verification section, where the user could choose to add any contact/identification information they choose (email would be the default if none were present, since it would be required to create an account). Before these screens, a password check would likely be used to ensure protection of such info.

This UI design allows the user to look at a list of lost items by clicking on the option from the main menu. This list will show the name of the lost item and the name of the owner. Another person can reference the general location of the lost item on the map by clicking on the location button. If the user finds the right item, he/she can post their information by clicking on the Found it on the List of Lost items on the right item. After posting the information, the user who lost the item can look in the list of found item, accessed from the main menu and gain the finder's contact info and once the user receive the item, the user can confirm that they received the item by clicking on the button which removes the item from the list of found.

This paper prototype shows the found posting function of the app. Here, users that found a lost item will be able to post the category of the item found (i.e wallet, phone, ID, etc...), the area in which they found it at, and a description of the item. On the next page that shows the list of lost items, the user will be able to select multiple users that lost the same item to see if the item lost is one of theirs. On this page, the user can also filter what item was lost and be able to see the distance from them where they posted that the item was lost. They can also click on the distance to see where on the map the item was proclaimed to be lost. Then they can mass message users with similar lost items.
