Feedback TA
- Figure out which app we like best, take ideas form other storyboards and merge it.
- Leaning towards the lost and found one.

Feedback from team K6:
- Going to the location to get their stuff back.
- How to verify if the object is theres?
- It is like lost and found on the FB page, but instead of words and text maybe we can have it as a map? Person cna put up lost item picture, then can enter location (plus name and contact). And the person who found it can put up picture, and map. 
- Can just be USCD.
- can't make notifications on web page...
- Transform all the text onto a big map to visualize the Lost and found.
- They like the idea
- Plant one may need a huge database and a camera.
- The friends nearby one may be a bit awkward, might be too big.
