Project Title: Lost and Found 

Tweet Description: 

Storyboard: Here are the new revised storyboard for our Lost and Found app. In this scenario, a user lost their lunch bag and through the Lost and Found app, they were able to post and show on th emap where they lost it. A user in the area found it, and contact the person that they found the lunch bag (in which the user who lost it was notified by a push notification). They were able to meet up and the person who lost their lunch bag was able to get it back.
This is part 1 of it:

Description of feedback: 
One of the feedbacks asked for the benefits for this app, since they said that they wouldn't use the app until they lost something and even then they would go on Facebook Lost and Found groups to see if anyone found it. On top of that, another feedback said that the Lost and Found idea was their favorite and suggested to make a map that lists all found items. So taking this feedback into consideration we decided to go with this idea as it seemed the strongest idea, we just need to figure out what we can do differently that would encourage people to use our app.

Description of proposed project's features: 
Using our storyboard and feedback, we further fleshed out our idea. Like hte preivious feedback, we can have a map that shows the general area where the user think their lost item is, and then check back to see if anyone found it. If possible, we can add push notifications to notify users if someone found it.
