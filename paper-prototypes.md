Description:
Showing the selection of the area the user thinks they lost their item at. The app will allow for them to adjust the size of the range of the area they may have lost the item at along with a little note they can put in saying specific details like floor levels, and things that one might not be able to see right away from a map.

Description:
My prototype shows how the user can choose where they lost the item on the map and add the details of their lost item on it as well. This can be applied to found items too. Basically when they tap the area, they can put the name of the item, an image, a description, and the time they lost it, and submit it. That way when other people look at the map they can see what other people lost.

Description:
This prototype is meant to show the interactions that occur when one has lost an item and wishes to post about it. They input the item lost, time believed to be lost, and general path it could have been lost along (indicated by drawing with finger on the map visualization). They then confirm this posting.

Description: 
This prototype details what happens when a user finds an item listed in the List of Lost. The user can use his/her current location or a preferred location to meet and then all the necessary information which will be posted in List of Found. User can confirm the item found once they meet the person with the correct ID, and then it'll delete it from the list of lost and found.
